# Epic Stack with Tailwind CSS Plugin

This example demonstrates how to integrate the Tailwind CSS Plugin into an Epic Stack project.

## Tailwind CSS Plugin Integration

To integrate the Tailwind CSS Plugin into the Epic Stack project, the following steps were taken:

1. Imported the plugin function from the package into the Tailwind CSS configuration file.

```ts
import plugin from 'tailwindcss/plugin.js'
```

2. Utilized the plugin function to add custom styles and extend the default styles provided by Tailwind CSS.

```ts
plugins: [
    plugin(function({ addUtilities, addComponents, addVariant }) {
      // Add your custom styles here
    }),
  ]
```

3. Customized the plugin's settings and utility classes according to the project's requirements.

By integrating the Tailwind CSS Plugin, we have enhanced the styling capabilities of the Epic Stack project, enabling extended functionalities and greater flexibility in style customization.
